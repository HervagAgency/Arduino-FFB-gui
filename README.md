# Arduino-FFB-gui
Graphical user interface for controlling and monitoring all aspects of the Arduino FFB wheel via RS232 serial port. Wheel control v2.0 supports Arduino HEX firmware from v170 and onward. You can use a stand alone wheel_control.exe file from the lattest release, it already has all Java stuff embeded. For more details on how to setup and use the program correctly please read manual.txt located in data folder.

The GUI is made in Processing 3.5.4 IDE from scratch and requires lattest Java 8. In order to compile the source yourself, you will need to install the following Processing libraries:
- game controls plus
- gp4 controls
- sprites
- control P5

Make sure that all pde files are located in the folder named wheel_control. Processing 3.5.4 IDE can be found here: https://processing.org/download
