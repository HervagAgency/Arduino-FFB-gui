# Arduino-FFB-gui
Graphical user interface for controlling and monitoring all aspects of the Arduino FFB wheel via serial port. Wheel control v2.0 supports Arduino HEX firmware from v170 and onward. You can use a stand alone exe file from the lattest release, that already has Java embeded.

Made in Processing v3.5.4, requires lattest Java 8. In order to compile the source yourself you need to install the following Processing libraries:
- game controls plus
- gp4 controls
- sprites
- control P5
